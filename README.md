# Particles-Dynamics-Simulator
 
his Python program simulates particle dynamics by taking inputs like coordinates, mass, and charge. It predicts particle trajectories, velocities, and applied forces, and calculates linear and angular momentum, torque, kinetic energy, and potential energy. The tool is ideal for visualizing and analyzing particle interactions in dynamic systems.
